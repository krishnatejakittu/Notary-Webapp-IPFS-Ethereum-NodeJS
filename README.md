# Notary Agreement on IPFS using Ethereum

In this project using IPFS, Ethereum, and NodeJS we implement a web application where Notary uploads a agreement to IPFS and Seller will view it and signs and approves it then Buyer will be able to view the agreement and sign and approve it.
Buy doing this we manage to authenticate the agreement by Notary, Seller and Buyer making it secured and safe.
